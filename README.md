- 👋 Meow, my name's Hope. Or Puma. Maybe Nadia 👩‍💻. Really, Koriykova Nadezhda Jurievna is a bit hard to pronounce :roll_eyes: 
- 👀 I’m interested in cats, some video games like "The Elder Scrolls" or "Deep Rock Galactic", and I love magic and fantasy worlds.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java on Yandex Practicum.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Java projects if you think I'm not too green for your team :D
